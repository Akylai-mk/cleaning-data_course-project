TidySet CodeBook

TidySet contains 180 rows and 80 columns, with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
Variables in the TidySet come from test and train sets, reduced to only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

Variable:          Description:                                                                         Origin:
ID                 Subject ID, personal identifier of subject who performed the activity for            "subject_train.txt", "subject_test.txt"
                   each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

Activity           Activity name. Has 6 categories: (1) WALKING, (2) WALKING_UPSTAIRS,                  "activity_labels.txt"
                   (3) WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, (4) SITTING, (5) STANDING, (6) LAYING
